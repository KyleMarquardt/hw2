    <font color=#000ff><h3>What I like most about travel</h3>

    <h4>Travel partners</h4>
    <p>In traveling, I've found that one of the most rewarding aspects of the trip
    is the relationship that you build with the other member or members of your
    group. </p>
    <p>One of my favorite travel companions is Nate Nasralla, visible in the brazil
    photo, but my all time favorite partner is my wife, Ndunge. She's very addaptable
    which is an important trait for international travel. In addition, she spent
    a year in Venezuela, where she practically became a local. All this makes
    her a fairly sophisticated traveller and one who I love to go on adventures
    with</p>

    <h4>Activities</h4>
    <p>Secondly, I really enjoy outdoor activities. In Nicaragua, I explored a cave
        and hiked through mountains. In Brazil, I spent 4 days on a 40 kilometer trek through
          the <b>Amazon jungle!</b> And in Kenya and Zambia, I went on Safaris.</p>
    <p> Thanks for reading my page! I hope you enjoyed learning about my travel
      adventures!</p></font>
